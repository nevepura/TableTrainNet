# TableTrainNet
## A simple project for training and testing table recognition in documents.
This project was developed to make a neural network which recognizes tables inside documents.
I needed an "intelligent" ocr for work, which could automatically recognize tables to treat them separately.

## General overview
The project uses the pre-trained neural network 
[offered](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md)
by Tensorflow. In addition, a 
[config](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection/samples/configs)
file was used, according to the choosen pre-trained model, to train with 
[object detections tensorflow API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection#tensorflow-object-detection-api)

The datasets was taken from:
* [ICDAR 2017 POD Competition](http://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/cpdp/ICDAR2017_PODCompetition/dataset.html).
* Not already implemented:
    * [UNLV dataset](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/UNLV-Testing-of-Tesseract#downloading-the-images)
    with its own
    [ground truth](http://www.iapr-tc11.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=Table_Ground_Truth_for_the_UW3_and_UNLV_datasets);
    * [Marmot Dataset](http://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/cpdp/data/marmot_data.htm)

## Required libraries
Before we go on make sure you have everything installed to be able to use the project:
* Python 3
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) (tested on r1.8)
* Its [object-detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection#tensorflow-object-detection-api)
(remember to install COCO API. If you are on Windows see at the bottom of the readme)
* Pillow
* opencv-python
* pandas
* pyprind (useful for process bars)

## Project pipeline
The project is made up of different parts that acts together as a pipeline.

#### Take confidence with costants
I have prepared two "costants" files: `dataset_costants.py` and `inference_constants.py`.
The first contains all those costants that are useful to use to create dataset, the second to make
inference with the frozen graph. If you just want to run the project you should modify only those two files.
 
#### Transform the images from RGB to single-channel 8-bit grayscale jpeg images
Since colors are not useful for table detection, we can convert all the images in `.jpeg` 8-bit single channel images.
[This](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320243569_Table_Detection_Using_Deep_Learning))
transformation is still under testing.
Use `python dataset/img_to_jpeg.py` after setting `dataset_costants.py`:
* `DPI_EXTRACTION`: output quality of the images;
* `PATH_TO_IMAGES`: path/to/datase/images;
* `IMAGES_EXTENSION`: extension of the extracted images. The only one tested is `.jpeg`.

#### Prepare the dataset for Tensorflow
The dataset was take from 
[ICDAR 2017 POD Competition](http://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/cpdp/ICDAR2017_PODCompetition/dataset.html)
. It comes with a `xml` notation file with formulas, images and tables per image.
Tensorflow instead can build its own TFRecord from csv informations, so we need to convert
the `xml` files into a `csv` one.
Use `python dataset/generate_database_csv.py` to do this conversion after setting `dataset_costants.py`:
* `TRAIN_CSV_NAME`: name for `.csv` train output file; 
* `TEST_CSV_NAME`: name for `.csv` test output file;
* `TRAIN_CSV_TO_PATH`: folder path for `TRAIN_CSV_NAME`;
* `TEST_CSV_TO_PATH`: folder path for `TEST_CSV_NAME`;
* `ANNOTATIONS_EXTENSION`: extension of annotations. In our case is `.xml`;
* `TRAINING_PERCENTAGE`: percentage of images for training
* `TEST_PERCENTAGE`: percentage of images for testing
* `TABLE_DICT`: dictionary for data labels. For this project there is no reason to change it;
* `MIN_WIDTH_BOX`, `MIN_HEIGHT_BOX`: minimum dimension to consider a box valid;
Some networks don't digest well little boxes, so I put this check.

#### Generate TF records file
`csv` files and images are ready: now we need to create our TF record file to feed Tensorflow.
Use `python generate_tf_records.py` to create the train and test`.record` files that we will need later. No need to configure
`dataset_costants.py`

#### Train the network

Step 1: importare un modello pre-allenato
Andare in [Model Zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md)
dove ci sono dei modelli frozen pre-allenati di reti.
Scarica quelli interessanti e li salvi nella cartella `trained_nets`: quindi in questa cartella ci sono i modelli pre-allenati.

Step 2: 
Andare in trained_models e creare una nuova cartella con nome a piacere, dove scrivi due file:
* command.txt
* il file di configurazione, per esempio `faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco.config`. Occhio che dentro ci sono alcune cose da settare, non solo i percorsi. Il fine tuning si prende dal modello frozen. Si possono scegliere altri parametri, come la batch size e l'optimizer.
* in questo step, tra i file che vengono generati, c'è anche `pipeline.config`, che viene usato allo step successivo
* una volta settati questi file puoi passare allo step 3

Step 3: lanciare il train con il file dentro la repo di TensorFlow

Step 4: puoi esportare il grafo da utilizzare per i test. Questa parte è stata fatta in fretta, quindi non si capisce bene.

Inside `trained_models` there are some folders. In each one there are two files, a `.config` and a `.txt` one.
The first contains a tensorflow configuration, that has to be personalized:
* `fine_tune_checkpoint`: path to the frozen graph from pre-trained tensorflow models networks;
* `tf_record_input_reader`: path to the `train.record` and `test.record` file we created before;
* `label_map_path`: path to the labels of your dataset.

The latter contains the command to launch from `tensorflow/models/research/object-detection`
and follows this pattern:
```angular2html
python model_main.py \
--pipeline_config_path=path/to/your_config_file.config \
--model_dir=here/we/save/our/model" \ 
--num_train_steps=num_of_iterations \
--alsologtostderr
```
Other options are inside `tensorflow/models/research/object-detection/model_main.py`

#### Prepare frozen graph
When the net has finished the training, you can export a frozen graph to make inference.
Tensorflow offers the utility: from `tensorflow/models/research/object-detection` run:
```angular2html
python export_inference_graph.py \ 
--input_type=image_tensor \
--pipeline_config_path=path/to/automatically/created/pipeline.config \ 
--trained_checkpoint_prefix=path/to/last/model.ckpt-xxx \
--output_directory=path/to/output/dir
```

#### Test your graph!
Now that you have your graph you can try it out:
Run `inference_with_net.py` and set `inference_costants.py`:
* `PATHS_TO_TEST_IMAGE`: path list to all the test images;
* `BMP_IMAGE_TEST_TO_PATH`: path to which save test output files;
* `PATHS_TO_LABELS`: path to `.pbtxt` label file;
* `MAX_NUM_BOXES`: max number of boxes to be considered;
* `MIN_SCORE`: minimum score of boxes to be considered;

Then it will be generated a result image for every combination of:
* `PATHS_TO_CKPTS`: list path to all frozen graph you want to test;

In addition it will print a "merged" version of the boxes, in which
all the best vertically overlapping boxes are merged together to gain accuracy. `TEST_SCORES` is a list of
numbers that tells the program which scores must be merged together.

The procedure is better described in `inference_with_net.py`.

For every execution a `.log` file will be produced.
