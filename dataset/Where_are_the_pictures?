The images used to train the networks in this project are part of the TableBank dataset
The part is the one that can be found in the original TableBank dataset archive, at path: "TableBank/TableBank_data/Detection_data"
The files contained in the folder "Recognition_data" were not used, because as far as i know, their use is to understand tables structure, not detecting their borders. Look at the readme of TableBank on github to better understand.
